# ReLayout: Reason CSS Flexbox implementation.

## This fork has been replaced by a separate repo [Relayout](https://github.com/jordwalke/ReLayout) so that continuous integration will work correctly, and so that it can be used as a standalone `npm` package. Even so, it is very much a fork/port of the [css-layout](https://github.com/facebook/css-layout) project.
